**URL:** https://www.recipetineats.com/melting-afghani-chickpea-curry/


**Ingredients:**
• 45ml ghee (substitute unsalted butter or coconut oil)
• 2 cinnamon sticks (substitute 2.5g powder, add with other spices)
• 250g onion, finely chopped
• 22.5g grated ginger
• 22.5g grated garlic
• 2 bay leaves, preferably fresh else dried
• 125g dried red split lentils
• 1L vegetable stock, low sodium
• 2.5g cooking / kosher salt
• 3 x 400g cans chickpeas, drained
• 0.6g baking soda / bi-carbonate soda
• 15g coriander powder
• 15g cumin powder
• 7.5g turmeric powder
• 3.75g cardamom powder
• 1.25g ground cloves

**Method:**
1. Melt the ghee in a large pot over medium high heat. Add the cinnamon and toast for 30 seconds.
2. Add the onion, ginger, garlic and bay leaves. Cook for 3 minutes until the onion is translucent (stir regularly so the garlic & ginger don't catch).
3. Add the spices and stir for 30 seconds.
4. Add the lentils and stir to coat in the spices.
5. Add the stock and salt. Stir, bring to a simmer. Lower the head to medium, put the lid on and simmer for 15 minutes.
6. Add the chickpeas, water and baking soda. Increase the heat to make it simmer again. Then lower the stove slightly and leave to simmer gently for 30 minutes without a lid or until the lentils are mostly broken down to make a thin gravy (you can cook an extra 10 minutes to thicken more if you want).
