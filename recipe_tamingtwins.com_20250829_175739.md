**URL:** https://www.tamingtwins.com/creamy-bacon-pasta/


**Ingredients:**
• 300g dried pasta (spaghetti)
• 1 onion, peeled and finely chopped
• 2 garlic cloves
• 240g streaky smoked bacon, chopped into 1cm strips
• 170g sundried tomatoes (in oil, drained and chopped into thin strips)
• 4 tbsp tomato puree
• 200g frozen peas
• 200g cream cheese
• Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

**Method:**
1. Cook your pasta according to the instructions on the pack, in a pan of well salted water.
2. Put your onions, garlic, sundried tomatoes and bacon into a pan and fry over a medium heat for 5-10 minutes until the onions are softened and the bacon is cooked through.
3. Five minutes before your pasta has finished cooking, add the peas to the pasta pan and continue cooking as normal.
4. When the bacon and onions are cooked, reduce the heat to low and add the tomato puree and cream cheese. Give everything a good stir and cook for 2-3 minutes until just heated through.
5. When the pasta and peas are cooked, drain (reserve a cup of the cooking water) and add the pasta and peas into the pan with the bacon and vegetables.
6. Add black pepper and a splash of reserved cooking water if you'd like a more runny sauce.
7. Give everything a good stir and serve immediately.
