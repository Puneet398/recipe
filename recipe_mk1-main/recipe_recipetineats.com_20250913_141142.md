**Ingredients:**
• 30-36g Thai Red Curry Paste
• 2 large garlic cloves, minced
• 10g fresh ginger, finely grated
• 15g lemongrass paste or finely chopped fresh
• 45ml vegetable oil
• 250ml chicken broth/stock, low sodium
• 400ml coconut milk (full fat)
• 6 kaffir lime leaves
• 15g sugar (white, brown or palm)
• 10g fish sauce, plus more to taste
• 350g chicken thighs (boneless and skinless), cut into 1.9cm thick slices
• 120g green beans, trimmed and cut into 5cm pieces
• 12 Thai basil leaves
• Fresh red chilli slices (small chilli – spicy, large = less spicy) (optional)
• Fresh coriander / cilantro leaves (optional)

**Method:**
1. Heat 45ml oil in a large heavy based skillet over medium high heat.
2. Add 30-36g curry paste and Extras (if using jar paste) and cook for about 2 minutes so it “dries out”.
3. Add 250ml chicken broth and stir to dissolve paste. Simmer rapidly for 3 minutes or until liquid reduces by half.
4. Add 400ml coconut milk, 6 kaffir lime leaves, 15g sugar and 10g fish sauce. Stir, then add 350g chicken.
5. Spread chicken out, bring to simmer, then turn heat down to medium. Simmer for about 8-10 minutes or until Sauce reduces, the chicken is cooked and the sauce is almost at the thickness you want.
6. Do a taste test. Add more fish sauce (or even shrimp paste) to add more saltiness, sugar for sweetness.
7. Add beans, stir. Cook for 3 minutes or until just cooked through and Sauce is thickened.
8. Remove from heat. Stir through a handful of 12 Thai basil leaves.
9. Serve over jasmine rice, garnished with fresh red chilli slices and fresh coriander/cilantro leaves, if desired.
