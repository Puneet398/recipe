**Ingredients:**
• 30ml olive oil
• 1 onion, very finely chopped
• 1 large garlic clove, crushed
• 175g risotto rice
• 400g can cherry tomatoes
• 600ml hot vegetable stock
• 30g parmesan or vegetarian alternative, grated
• 30g mascarpone or cream cheese
• ½ small bunch of basil, chopped

**Method:**
1. Heat the oil in a large, heavy-based saucepan. Add the onion along with a pinch of salt, and fry for 10 mins or until beginning to soften and turn translucent, then add the garlic and fry for 1 min. Stir in the rice and cook for 2 mins.
2. Tip in the tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Add half the stock, cooking and stirring until absorbed. Add the remaining stock, a ladleful at a time, and cook until the rice is al dente, stirring constantly for around 20 mins.
3. Stir through the parmesan, mascarpone or cream cheese, and basil, then season to taste. Spoon into bowls to serve.
