**Ingredients:**
• 2 tsp Sunflower oil
• 340g Meatballs
• 1 Onion, Peeled and chopped
• 3 Cloves of garlic, Peeled and chopped
• 300g Mushrooms, Sliced
• 400g Tinned chopped tomatoes
• 1/2 tsp Chilli flakes
• 2 tsp Sweet smoked paprika
• 750ml Vegetable stock
• 4 tbsp Tomato puree
• 250g Pasta
• 150g Mozzarella
• Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

**Method:**
1. Heat the sunflower oil in a large grill-proof, deep frying pan over a medium heat.
2. Add the meatballs and pan fry for about 5 minutes until starting to colour all over.
3. Add the chopped onion, garlic and mushrooms and fry for a further 5 minutes until the vegetables are starting to soften and the meatballs are browned all over.
4. Add the tomatoes, chilli, paprika, vegetable stock, tomato puree, dry pasta, and plenty of salt and pepper.
5. Give everything a good stir, put the lid on, reduce the heat to low and cook for 15-20 minutes, stirring regularly, until the pasta is cooked through and the liquid is absorbed.
6. If the pasta is not finished cooking and the sauce is too dry, add a splash of water and continue cooking until the pasta is done.
7. Preheat the grill to medium.
8. Sprinkle the cheese over the top of the pasta and pop under the grill to melt the cheese for about 5 minutes.
