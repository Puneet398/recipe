**URL:** https://www.tamingtwins.com/beef-stir-fry-recipe/


**Ingredients:**
• 500g steak
• 2 tbsp cornflour
• 2 tsp Chinese 5 spice
• 2 green peppers
• 3 spring onions
• 2 tsp red chilli
• 2 cloves garlic
• 4 cm ginger
• 2 tbsp tomato ketchup
• 3 tbsp soy sauce
• 3 tbsp sweet chilli sauce
• 3 tbsp rice vinegar
• 4 tbsp water
• 150g dried egg noodles
• 2 tbsp sunflower oil

**Method:**
1. Cook the noodles in a pan of boiling water according to the pack instructions.
2. While the noodles are cooking, prepare all of your vegetables and put to one side.
3. Prepare the steak by slicing into thin strips. Mix it with the cornflour and Chinese 5 spice in a bowl until well coated. Set aside.
4. Prepare the sauce by mixing all of the ingredients in a small bowl and setting aside.
5. When the noodles are nearly cooked, heat up a wok or deep frying pan with the sunflower oil in until very hot.
6. Add the steak strips (you may need to do this in batches so you don't overcrowd the pan). Don't shuffle them around TOO much or they won't crisp. As they get crispy and browned remove them to a side plate with some kitchen roll on.
7. Add the pepper and chilli to your now-empty pan. Cook for 2 mins.
8. Add the garlic, ginger and the spring onion. Cook for 1 minute more.
9. Add the sauce to the veggies in the pan. Cook until glossy, about 1 minute more.
10. Add the drained noodles and the browned steak to the pan and stir to coat everything in the sauce.
11. Serve topped with more spring onion and chilli if you like it hot!
